# Work module

The creation, updating and deletion of works is here.

### Note

There are 5 types of works:

- `'trial-work'`
- `'phrase'`
- `'mini-test'`
- `'test'`
- `'second-part'`

Special here is only `test` as it is checked automatically by the system.

There are also 4 types of task:

- `'word'`
- `'text'`
- `'essay'`
- `'final-`essay'`

The `word` task type is checked automatically, while all the other types are checked manually by the mentor and store richtext (currently in quill's Delta format).
